            C Programming Language: Its Important History and Why It Refuses to
            Go Away
          </h1>
          <p>
            C is one of the most important programming languages in the history
            of computing. Today, many different programming languages have
            popped up offering many different features, but in many ways, C
            provided the basis for such languages. C was born out of necessity.
            It is unclear whether its creators had envisioned the great things C
            would go on to achieve. Like most innovations, C underwent many
            changes over time. Probably one of its greatest achievements has
            been its ability to stay relevant even in modern, dynamic times. It
            must be fulfilling for the creators of C to observe that their
            creation is not considered outdated or categorized as useful for
            only a few niche areas. Instead, C has come to be recognized as a
            general-purpose, strong language that could be applied to many
            areas. (Read also: Straight From the Programming Experts: What
            Functional Programming Language is Best to Learn Now?.)

          <h4>The Beginnings of C</h4>
          <p>
            Developing C was not originally the objective of its founders. In
            fact, various circumstances and problems created the ideal situation
            for its creation. In the 1960s, Dennis Ritchie, who was an employee
            of Nokia Bell Labs (AT&T), along with some of his colleagues, had
            been working on developing an operating system that could be used by
            many users simultaneously.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This operating system was known as Multics, and it was meant to
            allow many users to share common computing resources. Multics
            offered many benefits but also had many problems. It was a large
            system and it seemed – from a cost-benefit perspective – that the
            costs outweighed the benefits. Gradually, Bell Labs withdrew from
            the project.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            That's when Ritchie joined Ken Thompson and Brian Kernighan in
            another project. The project involved developing a new file system.
            Thompson developed a new file system for the DEC PDP-7 supercomputer
            in assembly language.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thereafter, the creators of the file system made many improvements
            to it, resulting in the birth of the UNIX operating system. Even the
            origin of the name UNIX can be traced to its predecessor, Multics.
            Originally, the name was Unics (Uniplexed Information and Computing
            Service) as a pun on Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computer
            Services).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Later, Unics changed to UNIX. UNIX was written in assembly language
            which, though ideal for machine learning, was a difficult
            proposition for human beings. (What is machine learning? Find out by
            reading Machine Learning 101.)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To interpret and operate UNIX, the languages Fortran and B were
            used. It is here that the idea of developing the C language began to
            form in the minds of its creators.
