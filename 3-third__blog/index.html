            The Programming Languages That Built Email
          </h1>
          <p>
            The invention of email is arguably one of the greatest technological
            advancements in people's daily lives. Programming languages are at
            the core of email applications, and over time the choice of
            programming languages in building email services has changed. While
            Fortran was used to build the very first email service, powerful and
            feature-rich languages such as Ajax and Python are now preferred
            because the whole idea of offering email services has been evolving.
            Email users constantly want better experiences. For example,
            page-loading, search and storage features have changed a lot over
            the years. Now you have email apps, web-based email and desktop
            clients. (Learn about the evolution of programming languages in
            Computer Programming: From Machine Language to Artificial
            Intelligence.)

          <p>
            Almost any programming language out there can be used to build an
            email service. However, the choice of programming languages depends
            on many different factors. It cannot be said that certain
            programming languages aren't superior to others in terms of building
            an email service, but it is all about how much a language can
            fulfill requirements. Here we will review the various programming
            languages and their comparative abilities in helping build an email
            application.
          </p>
          <h4>Are There Specific Programming Languages for Building Email?</h4>
          <p>
            Any language that runs on a web server can help develop an email
            application. However, if you're planning to build an email
            application yourself, you need to keep in mind the following
            factors:
          </p>
          <p>
            Since you would need a database to store addresses, it needs to be
            compatible with the language you choose.
          </p>
          <p>
            You would need a server or a virtual private server (VPS) to run the
            email application. So, the operating system on which the server or
            VPS is installed will govern the choice of language.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as already stated, you do not want to just randomly pick
            out any language without making sure it fulfills your requirements.
            So, we will make a comparative analysis of different programming
            languages in the sections below. (Many businesses are opting for

          </p>
          <p>
            Note that an email application, like any software application, has
            two parts: server and client. Programming languages can power both
            server and client.
          </p>
          <h4>Factors in Choosing Programming Languages</h4>
          <p>
            Business or any other unique considerations should govern your
            choice of programming languages. Still, you may want to keep the
            following criteria in mind:
          </p>
          <p>
            The more features and interfaces you plan, the higher the
            possibility of choosing varied programming languages, and vice
            versa.
          </p>
          <p>Choose a language that is compatible across platforms.</p>
          <p>
            It is almost an axiom to have web-based or browser-based interfaces
            for your email application because potential users find them
            friendlier. Choose a web-friendly language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frameworks, plug-ins and libraries make the life of software
            developers easier. Choose languages like Java that have packaged
            libraries and plug-ins that are compatible.
