            The 5 Programming Languages That Built the Internet
          </h1>
          <p>
            The internet couldn’t possibly run without someone somewhere writing
            some code, but in internet history, there are a few particular
            languages that provided the foundation upon which the web we know
            today is built. These five languages have helped shape the modern
            internet. (To do some background reading, check out Computer
            Programming: From Machine Language to Artificial Intelligence.)

          <h4>Lisp</h4>
          <p>
            This language is actually not widely used on the internet, but is
            responsible for building the internet in many ways. Invented by John
            McCarthy in the late 1950s, Lisp, despite its odd name, tied
            together the research community that helped create the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spreading out of MIT, Lisp offered some modern features for the
            first time, such as conditionals. But what was really mind-blowing
            about Lisp was that it made no distinction between code and data.
            Lisp could treat code as data and data as code. Lisp makes it
            possible to extend the language in ways that its designers never
            intended, giving rise to the term "programmable programming
            language."
          </p>
          <p>
            Lisp became the lingua franca of the artificial intelligence
            community, the community that DARPA called on to build what
            eventually became the internet in the late 1960s. With the "AI
            Winter" in the late '80s, Lisp’s fortunes sank somewhat, although it
            still had its fans. One of them, Paul Graham, later to found the
            startup incubator Y Combinator, used it to build one of the first
            e-commerce companies, Viaweb, which was later purchased by Yahoo.
            Graham credited the ability to write powerful software by himself as
            one of the reasons for its success. The first version of the popular
            social news website Reddit was also built in Common Lisp.
          </p>
          <h4>C</h4>
          <p>
            The single most influential programming language today might be C.
            Invented at Bell Labs in the '70s, it was one of the first
            high-level programming languages to have an operating system written
            in it. And that operating system just happens to be Unix. Because it
            was written in C, it was possible to move Unix to different
            platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rewriting Unix in C was a major breakthrough. Previously, operating
            systems were written in assembly language, as they had to be really
            close to the hardware. C, on the other hand, was a higher-level
            language but was still close enough to the hardware to write an
            operating system in. This made Unix one of the first portable
            operating systems. A C program could be compiled to run on different
            operating systems, but since most of the early C programmers also
            happened to be Unix programmers, they tended to assume that their
            programs would be run under Unix and developed their code
            accordingly. Because it was relatively easy to port Unix to other
            computers, lots of people did so.
          </p>
          <p>
            C has obviously had a lot of success outside of Unix. Windows is
            coded in C, as are many other applications. As C creator Dennis
            Ritchie wrote, "C is quirky, flawed, and an enormous success. While
            accidents of history surely helped, it evidently satisfied a need
            for a system implementation language efficient enough to displace
            assembly language, yet sufficiently abstract and fluent to describe
            algorithms and interactions in a wide variety of environments." (To
            learn more about C, see The History of the C Programming Language.)
          </p>
          <h4>Perl</h4>
          <p>
            Perl isn’t as talked-about as it was in the '90s, but it is still a
            major part of the internet. In fact, it owes its popularity to the
            internet. Perl was invented in the late '80s by Larry Wall when he
            was working for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as recounted in a
            book called "Programming Perl." Wall needed a configuration
            management system to talk to several Unix computers on opposite
            coasts. None of the existing Unix tools could do the job, so he took
            the lazy route and invented a whole new programming language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wall, as recounted, released it in 1987 over Usenet and it attracted
            an instant community of developers across the growing internet, one
            of the first major open-source projects to gain traction before
            Linux. When the web took off, Perl found a niche as one of the
            languages of choice for developing dynamic web pages. Syntactically,
            it resembled C, but was implemented at an even higher level, without
            the need to manually manage memory. This meant that developers could
            write, test and debug programs quickly. Perl is very flexible,
            leading to some ugly code. Its combination of ugliness and
            usefulness has given it the moniker of "the duct tape of the
            internet."
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Python and PHP have stolen a bit of Perl’s thunder, its
            importance to the spread of the internet is undeniable. (Learn the
            basics of Perl in Perl 101.)
          </p>
          <h4>PHP</h4>
          <p>
            Speaking of PHP, this language has dethroned Perl as one of the
            major building blocks of modern dynamic web pages. Like Perl, it has
            a reputation for letting people write ugly code, yet it still runs a
            lot of websites that people use every day, including Facebook. It
            was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. (Learn the basics of PHP in
            PHP 101.)
          </p>
          <p>
            PHP might make computer scientists scoff, but if you want to be
            taken seriously as a web developer, it’s a skill you should have on
            your resume.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason that it’s become so popular is that PHP code can be
            embedded right into a web page. This means you don’t have to put
            your PHP script in a separate program and generate HTML code using
            Perl or C. This makes it very easy for people who already know HTML
            to learn PHP and add interactivity to their pages. It’s also easy to
            integrate PHP with a SQL server such as MySQL. Which leads to...
          </p>
          <h4>SQL</h4>
          <p>
            SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It’s a way to form queries
            for relational databases. It’s also relatively easy to learn, as it
            uses English-like commands. There are plenty of implementations,
            such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, which are popular open-source
            relational database servers. SQLite is a smaller variant used in a
            lot of applications, such as Apple’s iTunes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although invented by Edgar F. Codd in the 1970s, SQL and the
            relational database took a while to become popular. Oracle first
            popularized relational databases, then MySQL made it a must-have
            technology for building websites. The relational model provided a
            simple and efficient way to mange large amounts of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can create a good web app or service in any language, but you
            can’t go wrong picking one of the languages that have influenced the
            way the web has developed. (Continue your reading about the history
